#  Backend & System Design Implementation

This repository showcases the implementation of advanced backend and system design concepts learned and applied over 10 days. Each section below explains the concepts implemented and links to the relevant project.

## Implemented Topics

### 1️⃣ Advanced Backend Communication
- Implemented in **microservices architecture** to enable efficient service-to-service communication.
- Used in distributed systems for scalable backend interactions.

### 2️⃣ Message Queues & Pub/Subs (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams)
- Used for **asynchronous processing** and event-driven architectures.
- Implemented **Kafka for event streaming** and **RabbitMQ for queue-based messaging**.

### 3️⃣ Proxies & Load Balancers
- Integrated **Nginx as a reverse proxy** to manage API requests efficiently.
- Configured **AWS ALB/ELB** for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.

### 4️⃣ Redis (Deep Dive)
- Implemented **caching mechanisms** to optimize API response times.
- Used Redis for **session storage, rate limiting, and real-time analytics**.

### 5️⃣ Kafka (Deep Dive)
- Used **Kafka for real-time event streaming and data processing**.
- Designed **producer-consumer architecture** to handle high-volume data streams.

### 6️⃣ Common Design Patterns in JavaScript
- Applied **Factory, Singleton, and Observer Patterns** for cleaner and maintainable code.
- Used **Middleware Pattern** in Express.js for modular API design.

### 7️⃣ Advanced Database Concepts (Indexing, Normalization)
- Implemented **Indexing** to improve query performance.
- Designed a **normalized database schema** to prevent data redundancy.

### 8️⃣ Rate Limiting
- Integrated **Redis-based token bucket algorithm** for API rate limiting.
- Prevented **brute force attacks** by limiting requests per user/IP.

### 9️⃣ Captchas & DDoS Protection
- Implemented **reCAPTCHA** to prevent bot access.
- Used **Cloudflare & Nginx security rules** to mitigate DDoS attacks.

### 🔟 Sharding, Replication, Resiliency
- Designed a **sharded database system** for horizontal scalability.
- Implemented **master-slave replication** for fault tolerance.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Horizontal & Vertical Scaling
- Used **horizontal scaling (adding more servers)** to manage increased load.
- Applied **vertical scaling (optimizing resources on a single machine)**.

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Polling & WebSockets
- Built **real-time chat & notifications** using WebSockets.
- Used **long polling** for updating client applications efficiently.

### 1️⃣3️⃣ gRPC
- Integrated **gRPC for high-performance service-to-service communication**.
- Used **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** for efficient data serialization.

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Capacity Estimation
- Estimated server, database, and API load capacity for better resource allocation.

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Load Balancers
- Configured **Nginx and AWS Load Balancer** to distribute incoming traffic evenly.

### 1️⃣6️⃣ Testing Node.js Apps
- Wrote **unit tests using Jest** for backend services.
- Performed **API testing with Postman and Supertest**.

### 1️⃣7️⃣ Real-time Communication & WebRTC
- Implemented **peer-to-peer video calls using WebRTC**.
- Built a **real-time collaboration tool** with WebRTC and WebSockets.
