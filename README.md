[10-Day_Backend_System_Design_Plan.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19041949/10-Day_Backend_System_Design_Plan.pdf)
I have implemented these topics

Advanced backend communication – Used in microservices and distributed systems.
Message Queues and Pub/Subs (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams) – Used in asynchronous processing and event-driven systems.
Proxies, Load Balancers – Used to manage traffic in scalable applications (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB/ELB).
Redis (Deep Dive) – Used for caching, rate limiting, session storage, and real-time analytics.
Kafka (Deep Dive) – Used for event-driven architecture and log processing.
Common Design Patterns in JavaScript – Used in structuring maintainable, scalable applications.
Advanced Database Concepts (Indexing, Normalization) – Essential for optimizing database performance.
Rate Limiting – Used in APIs and security to prevent abuse (e.g., Stripe, GitHub APIs).
Captchas and DDoS Protection – Implemented in web applications to prevent bot attacks.
Sharding, Replication, Resiliency – Used in large-scale databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Horizontal and Vertical Scaling – Implemented to manage load (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling).
Polling and WebSockets – Used for real-time communication (e.g., chat apps, live notifications).
gRPC – Used for high-performance service-to-service communication (e.g., Google Cloud, Netflix).
Capacity Estimation – Used in infrastructure planning for cloud and on-premise solutions.
Load Balancers – Used in distributed systems to distribute traffic efficiently.
Testing Node.js Apps – Essential for ensuring application reliability in production.
Real-time Communication & WebRTC – Used in video calls, live streaming (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom).
